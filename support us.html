        </div>
        <div class="container five">
          <h4>How will my money be used?</h4> 
          <h5>Your money will be used to pay for the costs of running The Odin Project. This includes paying for the <br>
              servers that host the website, the domain name, and any other costs associated with running the project.<br> 
              Your money does not go towards paying the maintainers. All of our expenses are documented directly on <br>
              the <a href="#">Open Collective website.</a></h5>
          <h4>How can I donate?</h4>
          <h5>You can donate via <a href="#">Open Collective,</a> by setting up a recurring donation or with a one time payment.</h5> 
          <h4>What form of payments can I use?</h4> 
          <h5>You can usually pay by credit card through our Open Collective page. They also offer bank transfer, Paypal, <br>
              or other means in addition to or instead of credit card payments. When you go through the contribution<br> 
              flow, you'll see all the available payment methods.</h5>  
          <h4>What happens if you receive more donations than needed?</h4> 
          <h5>Any extra money that we receive will be used to improve The Odin Project, or will be saved for future<br>
              needs. This includes paying for new features, paying for new servers, and paying for any other costs<br>
              associated with running the project.</h5>
          <h4>How do I cancel my recurring donation?</h4>
          <h5>You can cancel your recurring donation at any time through your Open Collective profile.</h5>    
          <h4>What are the benefits of donating?</h4>
          <h5>Your donation helps us continue to provide a world-class and completely free coding curriculum for anyone<br>
              and everyone eager to learn. We believe that this material should be available for free to anyone that needs<br>
              it, and donations from those that have the means to contribute help keep it available for everyone!</h5><br>
          <h5>In additon to the above, donors get a special 'backer' role in our discord server as a small bit of recognition.</h5>
          <h4>How do I get the 'backer' role on Discord?</h4>
          <h5>Use the /opencollective command in our discord server to verify your Open Collective account. You will<br>
              then be automatically given the 'backer' role. You will be prompted to provide your Open Collective<br>
              username, which is found in the URL of your Open Collective profile. For example, if your profile URL is<br>
              https://opencollective.com/rick-astley your username is rick-astley.</h5><br>
          <h5>If you want to remove the role for any reason, contact staff on discord through ModMail.</h5> 
          <h4>Do users with the 'backer' role get any exclusive benefits?</h4>
          <h5>No. The role is just a way for us to show our appreciation for your support.</h5>
          <h4>Does becoming a donor mean I get priority support in the chat?</h4>
          <h5>No. We feel strongly that everyone should be treated equally in our community, regardless of whether or <br>
              not they are a donor.</h5> 
          <h4>I cannot afford to donate right now. What are some other ways I can help The Odin<br>
              Project?</h4>      
          <h5>You can help us by <a href="#">contributing to our open source projects.</a> You can also help us by spreading the word <br>
              about The Odin Project. Tell your friends, family, and coworkers about us. Share our content on social<br>
              media. The more people that know about us, the more people we can help.</h5>
          <h4>What ever happened to Thinkful? Viking Code School?</h4>
          <h5>When The Odin Project was created by Eric Trautman in 2013, it was primarily funded by Eric's other<br>
              project, the for-profit Viking Code School. Eric wanted Odin to be free, and kept it that way by placing a<br>
              small ad for Viking Code School on the website.</h5><br>
          <h5>In late 2017, Viking Code School was acquired by Thinkful. As a part of that acquisition, Thinkful agreed to<br>
              continue funding The Odin Project, in return for an ad on The Odin Project website.</h5><br>
          <h5>In 2019, Thinkful was acquired by Chegg. Chegg was nothing but supportive, and continued funding us the<br>
              entire time. However we began to feel that it might be in our best interest to become self-funding, to avoid<br>
              the risk of being acquired by a company that might not be as supportive.<h5><br>    
          <h5>In 2023, we decided to begin the process of parting ways with Chegg, and become self-funding. We are<br>
              now funded entirely by donations.</h5><br> 
          <h4>I still have questions. How can I contact you?</h4>
          <h5>You can <a href="#">contact us</a> through modmail on our discord server, or through email. See our contact us page for <br>
              details.</h5> <br>
